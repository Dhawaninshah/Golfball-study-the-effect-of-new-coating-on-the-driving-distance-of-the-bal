# Hypothesis testing on golf ball dataset
Par Inc., is a major manufacturer of golf equipment. It believes that it can increase its market share by introducing a new more durable golf ball with cut-resistant coating The tests with the coating of the ball has been promising and now it wants to see the effect of new coating on driving distance.

The objective of this Project is to study the “Golf ball” dataset using R and draw valuable insights from the data set with major focus to study the effect of new coating on the driving distance of the ball.



##Results
Descriptive Statistics
1. From Histogram, it is concluded that both the Models follows Normal distribution while Current is left skewed as most of its data are located at left of the graph and New is right skewed as most of its data is located at right of the graph.
2. From the box plot it can be said that there are no outliers.
3.Mean of the Current Model is 270.3 and mean of New Model is 267.5 and standard deviation of Current is 8.7529 and standard deviation of New is 9.8969.

The Inter quartile range of both the variable is equivalent to 12.
From Mean, it can be said that current Model balls cover larger distance than New model balls (from mean) but standard deviation is also large. So, we can say that there is not much difference in both the Model.

Hypothesis Testing
1. P value is 0.188 and hence we fail to reject Null Hypothesis. Hence, we can say that there is no significant difference between the driving distance of Current Model and New Model due to coating.
2. There must be some factor other than the coating that affects the driving distance.
3. As of now, Par Inc. should not introduce the New model in the market.

Confidence Intervals
1. 95% confidence Interval for Current Model [273.0743, 267.4757]
2. 95% confidence Interval for New Model [270.6652, 264.3348]
Thus, respective population mean should lie within this range for consistent results

Power of Test and Sample Size
1. Power of test is 0.144 which is low.
2. Sample Size: Test should be carried with larger sample size at least 104 balls.
3. It always better to take larger sample size for better results but should also take into consideration the other factors like cost, practicability and time.

Recommendations
1. Statistically there is no significant difference between driving distance of Current and New Model due to coating of the balls.
2. Par Inc., should continue their study and should consider other factors affecting the driving distance like the size and weight of the ball, its manufacturing material - stuffing, technology and number of dimples on it.
3. Par Inc should also consider the technology prevailing in the industry and products launched by their competitors.
4. As of now, to increase its market share it should focus on other areas like marketing , strategy and policy of their company and can make necessary changes there.
